# üíª XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):
XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities allow an attacker to inject malicious code into a website, which is then executed by the victim's browser. This can allow the attacker to steal sensitive information such as login credentials, manipulate the website's content or functionality, or redirect the victim to a different website.

This lab is a safe, controlled environment where you can practice finding and exploiting XSS vulnerabilities. These labs consist of a series of tasks that require you to identify and exploit XSS vulnerabilities in order to complete them. They can be useful for learning about XSS vulnerabilities and how to identify and prevent them, as well as for practicing and honing your skills in finding and exploiting these vulnerabilities.

It is important to note that these labs are intended for educational and research purposes only, and should never be used to attempt to exploit real-world websites or systems. It is also important to ensure that you have the appropriate permissions before attempting to access or test any website or system, as unauthorized access or testing can be illegal.
